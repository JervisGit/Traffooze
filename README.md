FYP-23-S2-23 -  Traffooze

The purpose of this project is to create a user-friendly application for users to use for their daily travels. The application will have a dashboard with live updates on the traffic conditions. The dashboard will give users information on traffic jams, accidents, road closures, and etc to alert users on which areas or roads to avoid. The application will also predict the estimated time required for users to travel from point to point and provide the fastest route to get to their destination.
